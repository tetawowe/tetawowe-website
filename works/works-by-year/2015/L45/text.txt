description: The client initially approached us with a rough brief to design a student housing. He wanted to replicate his experience as a student in London, many years ago and to encourage a sense of community among students of different backgrounds.

He also wishes to make it very simple. Something that is minimal and not loud, subtle yet functional. Since then, there has been integral changes to L45 as we further explore the brief by introducing a community library.

middle description: While the front half original portion is kept, we demolished the back half portion, and built a new extension following the profile of the original front half.

From the section, the original 2 storeys is modified to become a 2-storeys + 2 mezzanines, creating 8 rooms with ensuite bath and a sizable public library under one roof. Through the interlocking of spaces, we were able to play with spatial versatility that encourages interaction in creating these intimate corners.
