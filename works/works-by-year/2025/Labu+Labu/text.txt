description: Labu+Labu is a bakery store renowned for its Chicken Floss Balls. As the brand’s first dine-in café, it is located in a corner shop in Cheras, housed in a building that was formerly used as a bank. Upon entering the double volume space through the main entrance, the owners chose to remove all existing ceilings and partition walls, exposing the original concrete structure. The design intent was not to deliberately create an industrial aesthetic, but to respect the building’s original materials and structure while preserving elements and spatial layouts inherited from its banking past. The original blue floor tiles were retained and carefully adapted to organize the service counters and operational areas around the double-height space and structural columns. The remaining areas are dedicated to dining, furnished with a relaxed, eclectic arrangement of tables, chairs, and plants to create a comfortable and inviting atmosphere.

middle description: The space aims to accommodate every visitor with a humble presence, fostering a harmonious dialogue with its surrounding environment. Corrugated cement boards are installed on the most prominent wall, overlapping to form three subtle layers that emit a soft glow, quietly expressing the interplay between concrete and light throughout the space. Wood and plants engage in a continuous conversation across every corner, their presence felt at the service counter, dining areas, and even in the restrooms. On one side of the building, a glass panel was discreetly removed and replaced with a buffer zone constructed from red bricks and stone paves. This addition not only provides extra seating and functional space but also enhances the dialogue between the interior and exterior, creating a more dynamic interaction with the surrounding context.
