project-type: Private Residence

location: Gasing
project-year: 2025

description: Tucked quietly within Bukit Gasing, this residence is composed of several thoughtfully divided rooms. Rather than exaggerating its architectural presence, the house presents itself with an honest palette of red bricks, ventilation blocks, and greenery. We wanted the residents to each have a personal sanctuary, therefore every room is given ample living space, complete with its own planter box, outdoor area, bright and well-ventilated windows, and a private bathroom. The design focuses on enhancing the quality of the living spaces and establishing a strong relationship between the indoor and outdoor. From the street, one can subtly sense the lives unfolding within — each room quietly writing its own story.
