The shopfront seating is a direct respond to the tall trees opposite the road that greets the guest with a serambi (raised timber platform) in front and a series of artisanal weaving stools blend in with surrounding landscape.

Whereas the garden front is a celebration of outdoor al-fresco seating with a red brick garden setting (to be launched in phase 2) facing the sidewalk receiving the cyclist and pedestrian crowd from the main road, Jalan Sri Hartamas 22.

This working counter is presented as the centrepiece, as if the whole space focus on the ritual of coffee making, namely a Barista's ritual. Guests will find the handwashing experience at the washroom resembling coffee-making process of a classic coffee machine portafilter, setting another gesture of homage to Barista's ritual.

The internal dining space is carved into 2. First one is a dining hall with high ceiling comes with a huge window looking towards the landscape. Second one is a attic vibe with cosy banquette seating. A sliding shelf module allows both space can be connected to form a larger event space.
