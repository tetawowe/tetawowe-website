description: A conservatory within a conservatory - a restaurant amidst the urban landscape ​
Defined by its tree canopy-like roof supported by circular steel columns, the project creates a second conservatory membrane in within - a conservatory dining experience amidst the landscape at Tun Razak Exchange. 

​By puncturing round holes, the roof provides sufficient room for trees to be brought in and protruded through, allowing horizontal and vertical connections with its surrounding. A secondary steel frame conservatory membrane is inserted into the existing glass membrane, spanning over to demarcate the dining areas in within, while allowing necessary intensity of daylight to penetrate  through. 

The volume within is framed by continuous skin of glass wall, allowing necessary levels of daylight into the interior spaces while serving as a lens open outwards to the lushes of green. Not just the greens, one could simply appreciate the best view of Exchange 106 Tower while enjoying a wide range of main course, pastries or even just sipping a standard cup of coffee. Customer is served underneath a conservatory structure within the building structure itself, in par with the initial idea of preserving surrounding trees as a part of its structure.
