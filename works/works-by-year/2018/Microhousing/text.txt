Kuala Lumpur downtown is now experiencing a doughnutised effect, a phenomenon of city dwellers slowly moving out from city centre. One of the main reason is undoubtedly high property value vs affordability of house buyers, this swift of migration of the city dweller to the outer city creates emptiness at the city centre district. We believe, one way to reverse this trend is to create affordable houses that paired up with well thought urban planning, good urban design and interesting programmes, to attract people to move back to the city centre. 

With much optimistic we anticipate the public transport would be improved and with the popularity of uber and grab 
cars, city dwellers in the future are less dependent on private cars as commuting means, thus car parks become excessive and can be opted for different usages, eg. micro housing for this instance. Our design solution focuses on a mere 2 parking plots size (measuring 2.5 x 5m x 2 nos) on a hypothetical car park site owned by DBKL, with this in mind a design grid system of 2.5 x 5 is formulated. From there on, excessive car park plots will slowly be replaced by micro houses, driveways gradually turned into open place, green belts and bike lanes, unused car park plot in between houses can be adopted and turn into vegetables planting beds and various form of public space. This group of houses, in time, will grow into a urban micro village.
