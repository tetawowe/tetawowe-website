description: This project served as a simple exercise in playing with the idea of layering and 'add-on's (adding and reorganising). The Garden house is a result of applying new concepts to redecorate an old building.

The new layers include the courtyard that consists of a parking space and the entrance, new roofing, new gate, exterior floor finishes, and exterior natural embellishments.
