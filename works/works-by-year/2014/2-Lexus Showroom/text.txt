description: Located along the main thoroughfare running a beeline, otherwise prominently recognised as the 'automobile strip', in the city of Ipoh; stands the singularly unorthodox Lexus car emporium.

At first glance, the sizable structure boasts design intellect and simplicity to the naked eye. What seems to be an environmentally immersive equilateral functions as a Showroom & Sales Centre housing cars manufactured by Lexus. Distinct in its layout contrary to its neighbouring competitors, the Lexus Showroom displays its product in a way that satisfies the balance between showmanship and integrity.
